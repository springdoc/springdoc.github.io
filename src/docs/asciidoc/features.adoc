== Springdoc-openapi Features

=== Adding API Information and Security documentation
The library uses spring-boot application auto-configured packages to scan for the following annotations in spring beans: OpenAPIDefinition and Info.
These annotations declare, API Information: Title, version, licence, security, servers, tags, security and externalDocs.
For better performance of documentation generation, declare @OpenAPIDefinition and @SecurityScheme annotations within a spring managed bean.

=== Error Handling for REST using @ControllerAdvice
To generate documentation automatically, make sure all the methods declare the HTTP Code responses using the annotation: @ResponseStatus

=== Disabling the `springdoc-openapi` endpoints
In order to disable the `springdoc-openapi` endpoint (/v3/api-docs by default) use the following property:
[source,properties]
----
# Disabling the /v3/api-docs endpoint
springdoc.api-docs.enabled=false
----

=== Disabling the swagger-ui
In order to disable the swagger-ui, use the following property:
[source,properties]
----
# Disabling the swagger-ui
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false
----

=== Swagger-ui configuration
The library supports the swagger-ui official properties:

* link:https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/[https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-ui/usage/configuration/, window="_blank"]

You need to declare swagger-ui properties as spring-boot properties.
All these properties should be declared with the following prefix: **springdoc.swagger-ui**

=== Selecting the Rest Controllers to include in the documentation
Additionally, to @Hidden annotation from swagger-annotations, its possible to restrict the generated OpenAPI description using package or path configuration.

For the list of packages to include, use the following property:
[source,properties]
----
# Packages to include
springdoc.packagesToScan=com.package1, com.package2
----

For the list of paths to include, use the following property:
[source,properties]
----
# Paths to include
springdoc.pathsToMatch=/v1, /api/balance/**
----

=== Spring-webflux/WebMvc.fn with Functional Endpoints
Since version v1.5.0, a functional DSL has been introduced, thanks to this enhancement in the spring-framework: link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/25938[#25938]

It's an alternative functional API to the `@RouterOperations` annotations.

This is a sample DSL, to generate OpenAPI description to the webflux/WebMvc.fn REST endpoints:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
RouterFunction<?> routes() {
    return route().GET("/foo", HANDLER_FUNCTION, ops -> ops
            .operationId("hello")
            .parameter(parameterBuilder().name("key1").description("My key1 description"))
            .parameter(parameterBuilder().name("key2").description("My key2 description"))
            .response(responseBuilder().responseCode("200").description("This is normal response description"))
            .response(responseBuilder().responseCode("404").description("This is another response description"))
    ).build();
}
----

And the Demo code, using the functional endpoints DSL:

Since version `v1.3.8`, the support of functional endpoints has been added.
Two main annotations have been added for this purpose: `@RouterOperations` and `@RouterOperation`.

Only REST APIs with the `@RouterOperations` and `@RouterOperation` can be displayed on the swagger-ui.

*   `@RouterOperation`: It can be used alone, if the Router bean contains one single route related to the REST API..
When using @RouterOperation, its not mandatory to fill the path

*   `@RouterOperation`, can reference directly a spring Bean (beanClass property) and the underlying method (beanMethod property): Springdoc-openapi, will then inspect this method and the swagger annotations on this method level.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@RouterOperation(beanClass = EmployeeService.class, beanMethod = "findAllEmployees")
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> getAllEmployeesRoute() {
   return route(GET("/employees").and(accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)),
         req -> ok().body(
               employeeService().findAllEmployees(), Employee.class));
}
----

*   `@RouterOperation`, contains the `@Operation` annotation.
The `@Operation` annotation can also be placed on the bean method level if the property beanMethod is declared.

IMPORTANT:   Don't forget to set **operationId** which is **mandatory**.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@RouterOperation(operation = @Operation(operationId = "findEmployeeById", summary = "Find purchase order by ID", tags = { "MyEmployee" },
      parameters = { @Parameter(in = ParameterIn.PATH, name = "id", description = "Employee Id") },
      responses = { @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "successful operation", content = @Content(schema = @Schema(implementation = Employee.class))),
            @ApiResponse(responseCode = "400", description = "Invalid Employee ID supplied"),
            @ApiResponse(responseCode = "404", description = "Employee not found") }))
RouterFunction<ServerResponse> getEmployeeByIdRoute() {
   return route(GET("/employees/{id}"),
         req -> ok().body(
               employeeRepository().findEmployeeById(req.pathVariable("id")), Employee.class));
}
----

*   `@RouterOperations`: This annotation should be used if the Router bean contains multiple routes.
When using RouterOperations, its mandatory to fill the path property.

*   A `@RouterOperations`, contains many `@RouterOperation`.

[source,java]
----
@RouterOperations({ @RouterOperation(path = "/getAllPersons", beanClass = PersonService.class, beanMethod = "getAll"),
      @RouterOperation(path = "/getPerson/{id}", beanClass = PersonService.class, beanMethod = "getById"),
      @RouterOperation(path = "/createPerson", beanClass = PersonService.class, beanMethod = "save"),
      @RouterOperation(path = "/deletePerson/{id}", beanClass = PersonService.class, beanMethod = "delete") })
@Bean
public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> personRoute(PersonHandler handler) {
   return RouterFunctions
         .route(GET("/getAllPersons").and(accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)), handler::findAll)
         .andRoute(GET("/getPerson/{id}").and(accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_STREAM_JSON)), handler::findById)
         .andRoute(POST("/createPerson").and(accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)), handler::save)
         .andRoute(DELETE("/deletePerson/{id}").and(accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)), handler::delete);
}
----

All the documentations filled using @RouterOperation, might be completed by the router function data.
For that, `@RouterOperation` fields must help identify uniquely the concerned route.
`springdoc-openpi` scans for a unique route related to a `@RouterOperation` annotation, using on the following criteria:

* by path
* by path and RequestMethod
* by path and produces
* by path and consumes
* by path and RequestMethod and produces
* by path and RequestMethod and consumes
* by path and produces and consumes
* by path and RequestMethod and produces and consumes

Some code samples are available on GITHUB of demos:

=== Integration with WildFly

*   For WildFly users, you need to add the following dependency to make the swagger-ui work:

[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
     <artifactId>webjars-locator-jboss-vfs</artifactId>
     <version>0.1.0</version>
   </dependency>
